# learning_arb_rust

This work was initially done in ~september 2021 and then resumed in ~april 2022.
Continuation of the learning_arb project but now in rust. In ~october 2021 I became discouraged with learning dex arbitrage and stopped
specifically learing about it. After this my focus was on learning more about solidity and vyper.
